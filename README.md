# Transportation-Researcher
 I hold a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Ibadan, where my academic training strengthened my interest in understanding how people move within cities, how infrastructure shapes their choices, and how data‑driven insights can support more sustainable and equitable transport systems.
