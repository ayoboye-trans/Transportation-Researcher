TRANSPORTATION RESEARCHER • CIVIL ENGINEER • TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR & ACCESSIBILITY MODELING ENTHUSIAST
I’m Ayobami, a transportation researcher passionate about understanding how people move through cities and how mobility systems can be improved using data, behavioural theory, and accessibility insights. My academic and professional journey focuses on travel behaviour analysis, discrete choice modelling, accessibility metrics, toll demand forecasting, and the broader interplay between transportation infrastructure and human decision‑making. I’m committed to research that improves mobility, equity, and sustainability—especially in rapidly growing urban regions like Lagos.

 RESEARCH INTERESTS

	Travel Behaviour & Travel Demand Modeling
	Utility‑Based vs Count‑Based Accessibility
	Discrete Choice Modeling (MNL, NL, Mixed Logit)
	Emerging Mobility (TNCs, Robotaxis, Shared Mobility)
	Toll Demand & Revenue Forecasting
	Transportation Network Analysis
	Mobility Equity & Access to Opportunities


HIGHLIGHTED PROJECTS

LIB Transportation Modelling Portfolio (Major Study): A comprehensive end‑to‑end modelling workflow based on the Lagos–Ibadan Expressway (LIB) demand study which Includes:
	Data cleaning & EDA
	Multinomial Logit modeling with robust SEs
	Scenario forecasting (e.g., +10% toll every 5 years)
	Utility‑based vs count‑based accessibility measures.

TECHNICAL SKILLS 

1. Programming & Analysis

	Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)
	Jupyter Notebook
	Data Wrangling & ETL
	Statistical & Econometric Modeling
	Synthetic Data Simulation

2. Transportation & Urban Analytics
